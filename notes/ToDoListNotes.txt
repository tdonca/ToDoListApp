1. Create list view for entries

Main Activity:
	Linear Layout of TextView objects
	Linear Layout Info: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/LinearLayout


	I want on startup to load all saved tasks into memory, then create a TextView for
	each one to display in the linear layout

	Create TextView in onCreate():
		Create a TextView instance
		**Set its layout parameters by getting the LayoutParams of the parent view
		add to the target view with (target).addView(newView);


	Make Tasks Removeable:
		create an onClickListener that removes the view from the parent view when clicked
		new View.OnClickListener() { ...
		assign the listener to each task view object
